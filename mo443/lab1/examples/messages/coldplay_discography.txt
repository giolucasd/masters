Shiver

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me don't you

But on and on, from the moment I wake
'Till the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Did you want me to change
Well I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver

Sing it loud and clear

But you never even see me do you
And is this my final chance of getting you

But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me


Spies

I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, how do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear
I said, what do I know
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies

They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear, no
I said, which way do I turn
Oh, I forget everything I learn

That the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad cause you know
Though spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies

They're all spies

And if we don't hide here
They're going to find us
If we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

But the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good cause you know
Though spies hide out in every corner
That they can't touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies

Sparks

Did I drive you away?

You say, “Oh, sing one we know,”
But I promise you this,

That's what I'll do.

Yellow

Look at the stars,
Look how they shine for you,
And everything you do,
Yeah, they were all yellow.

I came along,
I wrote a song for you,
And all the things you do,
And it was called "Yellow."

 So then I took my turn,
Oh what a thing to have done,
And it was all "Yellow."

Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones,
Turn into something beautiful,
You know, you know I love you so,
You know I love you so.

I swam across,
I jumped across for you,
Oh what a thing to do.

 Cos you were all "Yellow,"
I drew a line,

Oh what a thing to do,
And it was all "Yellow."

Look how they shine for you,
And all the things that you do.

Trouble

Oh no, I see,
A spider web is tangled up with me,
And I lost my head,
The thought of all the stupid things I said,
Oh no what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle,
So I turned to run,
The thought of all the stupid things I've done,

I never meant to cause you trouble,
And I never meant to do you wrong,
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble,
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm.

Oh no I see,
A spider web and it's me in the middle,
So I twist and turn,
But here I am in my little bubble,

Singing, I never meant to cause you trouble,
I never meant to do you wrong,
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble,
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm.

They spun a web for me,
They spun a web for me,
They spun a web for me.

Everything's Not Lost

When I counted up my demons,
Saw there was one for everyday.
With the good ones on my shoulder,
I drove the other ones away.

And if you think all is lost,

Hoping everything's not lost.

You could feel it all around.

Then I'm sorry,
I don't let it stand in our way.

The things that I shouldn't have done.

We all know,
And I don't wanna live it alone.

And just think,
Ah, ah, oh.

Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed,

The Scientist

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a silence apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start


Clocks

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that cant be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing

Come out upon my seas,
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go

Daylight

To my surprise
And my delight
I saw a sunrise
I saw a sunlight.

I am nothing
In the dark
And the clouds burst
To show the daylight

Oooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooooh and I realise
Who cannot live without
Ooooh come apart without it

On a hilltop
On a sky-rise
Like a firstborn
Child

And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness
Breaking daylight

Oooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooooh and I realise
Who cannot live without
Ooooh and come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight X10

Green Eyes

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah the spotlight
Shines upon you

And how could
Anybody
Deny you

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you

Honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you,
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you

And honey you should know,
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes, green eyes, ohohoh...

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand.

A Warning Sign

A warning sign
I missed the good part then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so.

A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms

A Whisper

A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Who remembers your face
Who remember you when you are gone

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards.
Night turns to day,
And I still get no answers

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Who remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper


A Rush Of Blood To The Head

He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said "I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls

Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
Do back the things it did to you in return

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah...

He said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace.
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said "I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside my baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head

Honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace.
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge,
Oh meet me by the lane
When am I going to see
That pretty face again

Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head

Amsterdam

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole.

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited,
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
I know I'm dead on the surface
But I'm screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets

Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
You came along
And you cut me loose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose



X & Y

Square One

You're in control
Is there anywhere you want to go
You're in control
Is there anything you want to know
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

The first line of the first page
To the end of the last place
You were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

You just want somebody listening to what you say
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colors into one
And if you come undone
As if you'd been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one

What If

What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

Oooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Oooh, that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try
Ooh, that's right

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
You know the darkness always turns into light
Ooh, that's right

White Shadows

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise i'm waking up
All this space i'm taking up
All the sound is breaking up
Oh oh oh oh...

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that
You're part of the human race
All of the stars in the outer space
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise i'm waking up
All the space i'm taking up
I cannot hear you're breaking up
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh...

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you'll say it you'll mean it
And when you'll find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swim out on a sea of faces
The tide of the human races
Oh, an answer now is what I need
See it in the new sun rise and
See it breaking on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me

Fix You

When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And i…
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And i…

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


Talk

Oh, brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future
And I want to talk to you
Oh, I want to talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece
Tell me how you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going
And you want to talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
And nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk

X & Y

Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I want to love you but I don't know if I can
I know something is broken and i'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it any way I can

Oooh, oooh...
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing oooh, oooh...

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh...

Speed Of Sound

How long before I get in
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide
Before I know what it feels like
Where to, where do I go
If you never try then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll start before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
All Japan and China, all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent
Oh, oh, oh...

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it, then you'll understand

A Message

My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And i'm not gonna take it back
And i'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that i'm aiming at
And I'll get that message home

My song is love
My song is love unknown
And i'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And i'm not gonna take it back
And i'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that i'm aiming at
And i'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And i'm not going to stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
Oh, on a platform i'm gonna stand and say
That i'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love unknown
And i've got to get that message home

Low

You see the world in black and white
No color or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
As us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you want to see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you want to see it come down
There for throwing your arms around
And say "you're not a moment too soon"

Cause I feel low
Cause I feel low
Oh, yeah, I feel low
Oh, no
Oh

Cause I feel low
Cause I feel low
Oh, yeah, I feel low
Oh, no
Oh

The Hardest Part

And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part
It was the hardest part
And the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing but I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part
Oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
The silver lining the clouds
Oh and I, Oh and I,
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

Swallowed In The Sea

You cut me down a tree and brought it back to me
And that's what made me see where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf and kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself, you can only blame me

And I could write a song a hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong and you belong with me
And I could write it down or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

You put me on a line and hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I decide to go to sea
You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes
Made me realize what I could not see

And I could write a book, the one they'll say that shook
The world and then it took, it took it back from me
And I could write it down or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

And I could write a song a hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong and you belong with me
The streets you're walking on a thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong and you belong with me
Ah, what good is it to live with nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see
Oh, the streets you're walking on a thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong and you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
You belong with me, not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me, not swallowed in the sea


Twisted Logic

Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
It opened them up
And tonight
Rivers will run dry
And not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Looking for life on earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go

Created then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards

'Til Kingdom Come

One... Two...
Still my heart and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
Let me in, unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way i'm going
I don't know which way i've come

Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you i've waited all these years

For you i'd wait til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way i'm going
I don't know what i've become

For you i'd wait til kingdom come
Until my days, my days are done
Say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me


How You See The World

( Japan bonus track )

Are you missing something
Looking for something
Tired of everything
Searching and struggling
Are you worried about it
Do you wanna talk about it
Oh you're gonna get it right some time

Theres so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh you're gonna get it right some time
You're gonna get it right some time

It's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you learn

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
Your not gonna get hurt

Oooohhhhh...

Is there something missing
There's nobody listening
Are you scared of what you don't know
Dont wanna end up on your own
You need conversation
And information

Ohhhhhhhhh...

Gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

It's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
You can't believe a word

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
'Cos nobody can learn

Oooooh
Oooooh
Ooooooooh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world




VIVA LA VIDA OR DEATH AND ALL HIS

Cemeteries Of London

At night they would go walking
Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping

Through the dark streets they go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la la la la la la la le
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river
Where Victoria ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken

We go underneath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean

Singing la la la la la la la le
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London

I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open

Singing la la la la la la la le
And the night over London lay

Singing la la la la la la la le
There's no light over London today

Lost!

Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I've stopped
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along will come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the firing's stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well

Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well

Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you oh-oh, oh-oh

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head

Lovers In Japan

Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day we're gonna get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh oh oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

Reign Of Love

Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load

Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love

Locust wind
Let us stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

Reign of love
By the church, we're waiting
Reign of love
On my knees go praying

How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried
On a reign of love

Yes

When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes

When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us
In daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Saying Lord lead me not into temptation
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone

If you'd only, if you'd only say “Yes”
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

Hey

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming 'Let the windows down'
As I crawl to the ground

If you'd only, if you'd only say “Yes”
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness

Chinese sleep chant :
Ah sleep
I need
Sleep satisfies
Sleep satisfies (x2)

Sleep, sleep, sleep
Sleep, sleep
Sleep satisfies
Sleep satisfies

Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Sleep mystifies
Sleep mystifies

Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Sleep satisfies
Sleep satisfies

Sleep, sleep, sleep
Sleep, sleep
Sleep satisfies
Sleep satisfies

Viva La Vida

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Violet Hill

Was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God

Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft

Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

And if you love me
Won't you let me know

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

So if you love me
Why d'you let me go

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

Said if you love me
Won't you let me know

If you love me
Won't you let me know

Strawberry Swing

They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't want to waste a thing

Cold, cold water
Bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Cold, cold water
What you say
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait until the morning
Wouldn't want to change a thing

People leaving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna curve away
When It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Now the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Oh the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Death And All His Friends

All winter
We got carried
Away over on the rooftops let's get married

All summer we just hurried
So come over just be patient and don't worry
So come over just be patient and don't worry

So come over just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

Try, try...

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

The escapist :
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape

And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape



MYLO XYLOTO

Hurts Like Heaven

Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
"Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
"I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the arrow they shot, trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Of you
Cause you do
Oh you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface a name
Tonight the streets are ours
And we're writing and saying
Don't let 'em take control
No, we won't let 'em take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they're out to get us
How come they're out when they don't know the facts

So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with the spraycan soul
I'll be armed with a spraycan soul

You
Oh, you
'Cause you, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Yeah it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
And it hurts like heaven

Paradise

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night
She'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night
Away she'd fly

And dreams of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know the sun must set to rise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

Charlie Brown

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes

We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark

Us Against The World

Oh morning come bursting the clouds amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking to those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightening strikes
And the saints go marching in
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain saying

Slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw oh this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Major Minus

They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to

They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful cause nothing they say is true

No, don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard

Hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on

She can hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting
While my left hides under the chairs

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you

U.F.O.

Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river's gonna flow
It just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Then that light hits your eyes
I know, I swear we'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold

Bullets fly split the sky
But that's alright, sometimes
Sunlight comes streaming through the holes

Princess Of China

Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying "fast as I can
I got to go, I got to go"

Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart

Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on, and on and on and on

Once upon a time, on the same side
Once upon a time, on the same side
In the same game
Now why do you have to go
Have to go and throw water on my flame
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
I could have been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could have been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

You stole my star
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You stole my star
La la la la la la

'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
You really hurt me, oh
'Cause you really hurt me
You really hurt me

Up In Flames

So it's over
This time I know it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long

I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time you're flying on
This time I know no song
Can stop its lonely burn
Can stop it slowly going

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

Can't we pour some water on

Don't Let It Break Your Heart

And if I lost a map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

"When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on baby, don't let it break your heart"
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call
And she said

"When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you'll never hit the mark
Even in your rain and shadows
Still we're never going to part
Come on baby don't let it break your heart
Don't let it break your heart"

Up With The Birds

The birds they sang, break of day
Start again I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The birds they sang, all a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue, dream that lie till it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Might have to go
Where they don't know my name
Float all over the world
Just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armour might rust in the rain

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way
Oh yeah



GHOST STORIES

Always In My Head

I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget
My body moves,
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen
Out from the rest

Magic

Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic
When I'm with you
And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view
And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
Such a precious jewel

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you

Want to fall, fall so far
I want to fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it magic

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well yes I do
Well yes I do
Well Yes I do
Well yes I do
Of course I do

Ink

Got a tattoo said 'together thru life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright
Feels like there's something broken inside
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
Just want a way of keeping you inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

True Love

For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
A fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie
Lie to me

Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

And call it true
Call it true love
Call it true
Call it true love

Midnight

In the darkness
Before the dawn
In the swirling
Of this storm
When I'm rolling with the punches
And hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
In the darkness
Before the dawn
In the darkness
Before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Another's Arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me
Or someone there to find me

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms
And that's just torture to me
Another's arms
Another's arms
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Pull yourself into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body

Oceans

Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
And I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain
Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the change
Meet me in blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain

You've got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone

A Sky Full Of Stars

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
Because you light up the path

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view

O

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
Fly on

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise, following them up
Still I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
Fly on

Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on

All Your Friends

On and on
You're told which side you're on
I forced your throne
To become science to cut the con
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away we blow
All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away we're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
Call comes in on the radio
I felt you go
And red now, all the rivers flow
Poppies grow

All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away we blow
All your friends think
Ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset
And we're taken home
Open fire
Open fire

Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just ride and fire

Ghost Story

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you travel
Travel over near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptied by 'em, anybody knows
Maybe I'm on a rose
Or am I even here
Yeah

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here
What's the point in trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter of the wrong cause
Fallen out of rose
Something people fear
Yeah

And every time I find I'm off the walls
It's all becoming clear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here
What's the point in saying 'Rescue me!'
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
And every time I find I'm off the walls
It's all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear



A HEAD FULL OF DREAMS

A Head Full Of Dreams

Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
Saying it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
It's a love, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

I sing, oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
Now you got me open handed
Now you got me lost for words

I sing, oh
A head full of dreams

Into life, I just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Birds

Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escaping
Will keep you up at night
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
But someone had put the flare up
Got me in the rays
So I guess I better stay

Uh, no come on! you say
It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start
"What if I won't see you again?"

Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love
Start the riot, and come on rage with me...
We don't need words
We'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on, and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it, say loud
Come on, all for love
Out from the underground
Away with me
We don't need words

Close your eyes and see
We'll be birds
Flying free!
Holding on in the mystery

Fearless through this
You said we'll go...
Through this together oh...
So when you fly won't you?
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool

Hymn For The Weekend

I said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we shoot across the sky
Symphony
Then we shoot across the sky
Pour on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Then we shoot across the sky
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
Oh, angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

And said, drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring in symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I oh I oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh, angels sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Soaring in symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

I-Oh-I-Oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I-Oh-I-Oh
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Then we shoot across the sky
Then we shoot across the...
Then we shoot across the sky
Then we shoot across the...
Then we shoot across the sky
Then we shoot across the...
Then we shoot across the sky
Then we shoot across the...
Then we shoot across the sky
Then we shoot across the...

Everglow

Oh they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
Yeah we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we died
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And know I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know you're always with me
And the way you will show
'Cause you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, it's everglow

Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

Adventure Of A Lifetime

Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again!)
Oh you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again!)

You get me through

And if we've only got this life
In this adventure oh then I

Fun

(Feat. Tove Lo)

I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over
An ocean that waits for a storm

The sun on snow rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
I know it's over a parting of ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun, oh
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always

We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
Oh come on don't give up
Don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun
Oh, didn't we have fun

I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
I know it's over Icarus says to the sun

The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over, fight 'til it's done

Didn't we have fun
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun
Oh-oh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah

Now we're stopping the world, stopping its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

'Cause you and me, you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me, you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me, you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to
Hey-ey-ey-ey

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun

But then
Maybe we could again

Kaleidoscope

This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival

Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide

Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
And be standing here beside you right

I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through

Amazing Day

We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof, your hand in mine, singin'
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"

And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and all its weight"
Here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
We sat on a roof, named every star and
You showed me a place where you can be what you are

And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I'm drifted away
And in your arms, I just want to sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day

And I asked can the birds in poetry chime
"Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"
Oh, thanks God must have heard when I prayed
'Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Today

Up & Up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain"
Up and up, Up and up

We’re gonna get it, get it together, right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up

How come people suffer
How come people part
How come people struggle
How come people break your heart
Break your heart

Yes I want to grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We’re gonna get it, get it together, right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We’re gonna get it, get it together, right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and

We’re gonna get it, get it together, right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up
Don’t ever give up

Miracles

(Japanese Bonus Track)

From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes in your eyes
I see the beauty in the world

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
Eyes
i'm a robot i copy i paste i hate myself
Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

Believe in miracles

Oh hey, I'm floating above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating above the world now

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah



EVERYDAY LIFE

Church

What can I tell you
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
But what can't I get through
When for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer

And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave

'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I go to your church

When you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me
When you're riding a wave

(Arabic By Norah Shaqur)

I worship in your church, baby, always
I worship in your church, all the seven days
I praise and praise

 Trouble In Town

Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
Blood on the beat
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
The law of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat

And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get released

Trouble in town
Because they hung my Brother Brown
Because their sstem just keeps you down
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I just get more police, yeh
And I get no comfort
And I get no name
Everything is getting strained

Best friends
What's that
What's his name
X (Standby, sir)
Alright, is that X your middle name
Of course, it's on a vehicle ID, right
You gettin' smart
'Cause you'll be in a fucking car with him
I'm telling you
Fucking smartass
I'm asking you what the X is, is that your middle name
Of course, what is it
Don't come back with the "What is it?" fucking shit
Talk to these fucking pigs on the street that way, you ain't talking to me that way
I don't talk to nobody in the streets, I don't hang with nobody
Well then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey
I have family out here
Everybody thinks they're a fucking lawyer and they don't know jackshit
Are you supposed to grab me like this
Grab you up
I'll grab you any way I got to
You're not protecting me while I'm trying, while I'm trying to go to work
Why don't you shut up

'Cause the Lord will shine a light for me
(Shine a light on me)
Oh, the Lord will shine a light on me
(Shine your light on me)
Sing-it-now

Daddy

Daddy, are you out there
Daddy, won't you come and play
Daddy, do you not care
Is there nothing that you want to say

I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say

You're so far away
Oh and you're so far away
That's okay
That's okay
I'm okay

Daddy, are you out there
Daddy, why'd you run away
Daddy, are you okay
Look Dad, we've got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I want to say

Is you're so far away
Oh and you're so far away
That's okay
It's okay
It's okay

You're so far away

Won't you come and won't you stay
Please stay
Oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay
One day
Just one day

WOTW / POTP

In a world gone wrong
I shall be strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

In a world afraid
Love, faith is strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

In our world tonight
Let's get it right
And I will the strength
Of an eagle
In our world tonight
I might be right
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Arabesque

(Feat. Stromae)

I could be you, you could be me
Two raindrops in the same sea
You could be me, I could be you
Two angles of the same view
And we share the same blood

Comme deux gouttes d'eau
On se ressemble
Comme provenant de la même mère
Comme deux ruisseaux (You could be me)
Qui se rassemblent (I could be you)
Pour faire les grandes rivières
And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future

The same fucking blood
The same fucking blood

When I Need A Friend

Holy, Holy
Dove descend
Soft and slowly
When I'm near the end

Holy, Holy
Dark defend
Shield me, show me
When I need a friend

Slowly, slowly
Violence, end
Love reign over me
When I need a friend

Hombre, mire
Ah, propiamente
Para toda la gente ha sido motivo de burla
Por que todo el mundo piensa que es una cosa imposible
Que es cuestión de locos
El problema es que todo es increíble
Y la gente no lo acepta

Guns

Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgment of this court is we need more guns

Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's going fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Melt down all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns
Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns

Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Orphans

(I want to know when I can go)
(Back and get drunk with my friends?)

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, "Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
Indigo go up to heaven today
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
She say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, "Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say

Oh I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (yeah)

Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Cherubim seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

Oh I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

Èkó

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrim's going nowhere in millions of cars

Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
When there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his Queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride

Cry Cry Cry

Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry

In a book about the world
Called The Luminous Things
There are trees and flowers glowing
While Jizo Bodhisattva sings

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side

(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want us to hurt each other (Dum-dum-dum)
Or cause each other pain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want to feel what they don't know (Dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) We're in this together, baby (Dum-dum-dum)
We're as singing is to rain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
So I'll never, never, ever let you go (Dum-dum-dum)

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky

Old Friends

Tony was a friend of mine
We were together all the time
And he had my back
Once he really saved my life

Sometimes, I want to call him
Say, "Hey, let's stay up 'til morning"

And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends

We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends
And there are no ends to old friends
Amen

بنی آدم

[Persian:]
بنی آدم اعضای یکدیگرند
که در آفرینش ز یک گوهرند
چو عضوی بدرد آورد روزگار،
دگر عضوها را نماند قرار
تو کز محنت دیگران بی‌غمی،
نشاید که نامت نهند آدمی

May there be peace and love and perfection throughout all creation, through God
May there be peace and love and perfection throughout all creation, through God

Gi nwa nke chukwu, gini ka ina ekwu
N'ihi ihe nile
Nke chukwu mere

Champion Of The World

Gi nwa nke chukwu, gini ka ina ekwu
N'ihi ihe nile
Nke chukwu mere

I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocketship reversed
Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world

(When I sail) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Know I might fail) Knowing I might fail
But, still I'm hoping for the best
(In my dreams) And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"

So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world

Everyday Life

What in the world are we going to do
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be
Am I the future or the history

'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy

'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Yes

Flags

(Feat. Will Champion / Japanese Bonus Track)

Talk amongst the skeletons this morning
Aside from all the medicine and health
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same
Is there something that you'd tell your former self
There were those that wished they'd spun upon a jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be

To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free like everyone else
There will be no flags to warn me
'Cause I just want to be myself

You'll let telephone in by a region
Is there any advice that you could give
When you know you're not like them
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live

And the Holy Roman Army
Said your heart beats like everyone else
You don't need no flags to tell you who you are
I just want to be myself

There's an aura that surrounds me
There's a different kind of wealth
And I don't need flags to know you're really something
And I just love you for yourself
Oh, I just love you for yourself



MUSIC OF THE SPHERES
Higher Power

Three, two, one

Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright

Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long, I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on

Humankind

Today I heard the strangest
I heard the strangest song
A DJ a star away is
Playing it to turn us on

My heart started glowin'
I feel it inside, it is flowin'

I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

Today I had the strangest
Feelin' that I belong

Before I was dyin'
I feel it inside, now I'm flyin'

I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

Oh
Alright

Before I was dyin'
I feel it inside, now I'm flyin'

I know, I know, I know
Wе're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're dеsigned
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But we're capable of kindness
So they call us humankind

Let Somebody Go

(Feat. Selena Gomez)

(Let somebody, let somebody go)

We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars 'cause this I know

That it hurts like so
To let somebody go

All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do
When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go (Body go)
(Let somebody, let somebody go)

When you love somebody
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody know
When you love somebody
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody know
So when you love somebody
When you love somebody

Then it hurts like so
To let somebody go
It hurts like so
To let somebody go

But you're still with me now, I know
(Let somebody, let somebody go)
Oh (Let somebody, let somebody go)
But you're still with me now, I know

(Human Heart)

(Feat. Jacob Collier & P. & A. Strother)

Boys, boys don't cry
Boys keep it all inside
I try to hide it underneath
Still my heart starts to beat

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart
Oh, my human heart
Night and day, light and dark
Any day it could be torn in half
Only got a human heart

[Verse 2: Paris Strother & Amber Strother]
Girls can make-believe
Girls wear it on their sleeve
Thought I could pretend for tryin' sake
Still my heart had to break

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart
Oh, my human heart
Night and day, light and dark
Any day it could be torn in half
Only got a human heart

People Of The Pride

People on the left
People on the right
Got a lion inside
People of the pride
Let's go

There's a man who swears he's God
Unbelievers will be shot
There's a man who walks around
Like he owns the fucking lot
There's a man who takes his time
From his homemade cuckoo clock
And he makes us march around it
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

There's a crocodile cross-eyed
There's a turning of the tide
We're no longer gonna fight for
Some old crook and all his crimes
There's a sewing up of rags
Into revolution flags
Got to stand up to be counted
Be an anthem for your times
It's just work

It's just work
It's not easy and we could all be blown apart
And heaven is the fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark
It's just work, believe me
Still my beating heart
We'll all be free to fall in love
With who we want and say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
People of the pride
Go

Biutyful

All I know
Is I love you so

I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Change for your pocket, someone for the night
I hope they name you a rocket and take you for a ride for free
And if they tell you you're nothin', maybe you'd explain
To me, you're the summer sun after the rain
And you were there when I needed
Somethin' for the pain, you see

When you love me, love me, lovе me
When you love mе, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I'm nowhere else
I'm on top of the world, man
On top of the world

And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Watermelon moon, so happy you're alive
And I feel like a river, finally arrived at sea

'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be
On top of the world, man
On top of the world

And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be
On top of the world, man
On top of the world

And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful

Coloratura

Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out
Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself and love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now

In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto, Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you

And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
All the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue
Oh, it's a crazy world, it's true
Sing it out

And in this crazy world, I do
I just want
In this crazy world, it's true
I just want you

Poets prophesy up in the blue
Together, that's how we'll make it through

Stuck in a corner
Are monkeys in cages
That don't have a number
To fight one another
Try to recover
Climb up the ladder
Look up and you see birds
Blind as each other
How long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other
On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer
Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us
How soon is now? yeah
How long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
With something together
Come on stick together
On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer


2000 Miles

( Cover / Christmas 2003 )

She's gone 2000 miles
It's very Far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day
I miss her

I hear Children singing
It felt like Christmas Time
In these frozen silent nights
Sometimes in a dream
You Appear

Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow, sparkle
Our hearts was singing
It felt like christmas time

2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you where ever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you where ever you go

She's gone 2000 miles
It's very far
The snow came falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

I hear people singing;
It felt like Christmas time
I hear People singing;
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singing;
It felt like Christmas time
I hear People singing;
It felt like Christmas time


A Ghost

They're calling you
Some kind of ghost
But I know that's not true
Cause time and time again I spoke
And I have spoke with you
They're saying I
Am some kind of ghost
But that's so hard to say
Maybe I'll go
Maybe you're safe
No there's no way to say...
And I would love you
To come over
And I would love you
Too


Animals

Animals we are
Disposable, collapsable and raw,
In you go into some crowded room

And animals that climb
And they're climbing over you until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
And I'm looking for an answer just like you
I should know which way to turn

An animal that runs,
And I ran away from you because I'm scared
"Off you go, off you go"

If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you now
So if you're gonna go
Go now

Animal you are
Disposable, defenceless yes and
Watch your mouth, boys watch your mouth

I'm an animal that runs,
And I made all my excuses to you
And I missed my chance by a stones throw

If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you now
So if you're gonna go
Go now
Go now
Go now
Go now

One

Now crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal


A Spell A Rebel Yell

As far as I can see
All time and circuitry
Is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me
A song

'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell

Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me
So long

All I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell

A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell

Atlas

Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh
We're about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord 'cause I
I'm about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world and all your hurt
Carry your world...

Bigger Stronger

( Safety EP )

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car,
To take me anywhere in seconds,
To take me anywhere I wanna go,
And drive around a faster car,
I will settle for nothing less,
I will settle for nothing less.

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car,
At the touch of a button,
I can go anywhere I wanna go,
And drive around my faster car,
I will settle for nothing less,
I will settle for nothing less.

I think I want to change my attitude.
I think I want to change my oxygen.
I think I want to change my air,
My amorous fear, I wanna choke.

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car,
To take me anywhere in seconds,
To take me anywhere I wanna go,
And drive around my faster car,
I will settle for nothing less,
I will settle for nothing less.

I think I need to change my attitude,
I think I want to change my oxygen.
I think I want to change my air,
My amorous fear, I wanna choke.

Bigger, better.
Bigger and better.
Bigger and better.
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car,
At the touch of a button,
I can go anywhere I wanna go....


Bittersweet Symphony

(Live At Live8 / Coldplay feat. Richard Ashcroft)

Chris Martin :
This is probably the best song ever written
And he's the best singer in the world, Mr. Richard Ashcroft

Ok, here we go

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
where all the veins meet, yeah

You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
from one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?

Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds
that recognize the pain in me, now
I let the melody shine,
let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
from one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
where all the veins meet yeah

You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
from one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?

I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?, Ooh

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
My life
Your life
Their lifes

Come take it down the only road I've ever been down
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
This life, this life, this life...

Thank you...

Careful Where You Stand

( Shiver EP )

I feel safe, I feel warm when you're here,
When I do no wrong,
I am cured, when I'm by your side.
I'm alright, alright.

I am safe, when I am with you,
And I feel warm, If you want me to,
I am cured, when I'm by your side.

Christmas Lights

Christmas night
Another fight
Tears we cried, a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tried to right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Cup of candles, oh they flicker
Oh, they flicker and they flow
And I'm up here holding onto all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you, darling
And I always will

But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on a

Crests Of Waves

It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no
I could be lost
Or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again
Screaming out from the crests of waves
It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Like a light lit upon a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve
You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make

Screaming out from the crests of waves
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where your longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where your longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves


Death Will Never Conquer

( Viva la vida B-side )

If sweet death should ever conquer me
Let me know boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
Let me go boys, let me go
One day death is going to conquer me
I'll be down where the waters flow
I hope sweet heaven has a place for me
Let me know boys, let me know

If sweet death should ever conquer me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free
Let me go boys, let me go
If you hear him coming, won't you say for me
That I just don't want to go...

Easy To Please

( Brothers & Sisters EP )

Love; I hope we get old,
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all.
Love; I hope we can be,
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please, so easy.
Love; I hope we grow old,
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all.
Love; I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please, so easy

For You

( Shiver EP )

If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for too

And the way you seem to flow
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control, with you

Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

Your eyes closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope
For you (x10)


Glass Of Water

( Prospekt's March EP )

Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the rhymes
And he asked, will I see heaven in mine

That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh, they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine

Son
Don't ask
Neither how full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic
Figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And we chimed, stars in heaven align

Son
Don't ask
Neither how full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

And what are we drinking when we're done
Glasses of water

Gold In Them Hills

( Collaboration with Ron Sexsmith )

I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
Maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling

But if we'd only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

Every now and then life says
Where do you think you're going so fast
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind

And if we'd get up off our knees
Well then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills and horizon

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say...

A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
And we'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hills

There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

There's gold in them hills...
There's gold in them hills...


Gravity

( Talk EP Dvd Version )

Baby
It's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh the way that gravity pulls
On you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes
On everyone
On everyone

Baby
When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come on around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh the way that gravity pulls
On you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone


Harmless

So I heard you say,
I got your getaway.
I'm on a second trail,
As clear as crystal.

But it was harmless,
It couldn't hurt you.
Oh you were helpless,
I know you'll get through.

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days gone by
Oldest friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us
Once more

Through the years, we all have been together
If the saints allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Help Is Round The Corner

( Yellow EP )

Stuck here, in the middle of nowhere,
With a head ache, and a heavy heart,
Well nothing was going quite right here,
And I'm tired, I can't play no part.

 Oh come on, come on,
Oh what a state I'm in,
Oh come on, come on,
Why won't it just stay here

 Help is just around the corner, for us. 

Oh my head won't stop aching,
And I'm sat here, licking my wounds,
I'm shattered,
But it really doesn't matter,
'Cause my rescue is going to be here soon.

Oh come on, come on
What a state, I'm in,
Oh come on, come on,
Why won't it just sink in?

Help is just around the corner, for us,  
Help is just around the corner, for us,
Help is just around the corner, for us.

Here Comes The Sun

( The Beatles / Live Cover Chicago 2001 )

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it seems so long since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, I say
It's all right

Little darling, I see those smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems so long since it's been here
Here comes the sun little darling
Oh, here comes the sun, I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, It seems the ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems so long since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
It's all right

How You See The World No.2

(from the album Help : A Day In The Life)

You put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit,
When they sliced and packaged it

In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat

You wanna get it right, sometimes

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
But If your hear, can you let me know?

How can they invade it?
When it's so complicated?
Oh you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

It's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you learn

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt

And there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle,
How can you be too careful?

We don't wanna be man-trapped,
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
We just wanna get it right, sometimes
We just wanna get it right, sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard,
But you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world,
But don't you worry yourself
Cause nobody can hurt you...

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world


Hunting High And Low

( A-ha cover / Live Einslive Radiokonzert 10-07-2002 )

Here I am
And beyond the reach of my hands
She sounds asleep and she's sweeter now
Than the wildest dreams
Could have seen her
And I Watch her slipping away
And I know I'll be hunting high and low

High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

Find her again
Upon this my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I know I'll be hunting high and low

High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and Low
High
Do you know how it feels to love you
Do you know how it feels to love you
High and low

I Bloom Blaum

Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine
Where do you go to, pretty babe
Where do you go to when the night wins away well
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do
Who do I sing for
Well honey I sing about you
You

I Ran Away

One, two, three... Will

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do

And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closed

I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

A star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cage

Just a single star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you


Ladder To The Sun

( Live )

From the very start
It came apart
It broke up into pieces and
There's a chance I could have missed it
It could risked it
So I put myself into your hands

Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Yeah, you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

I could run my courses and
Opposing forces
And all men are just mortals and
Oh if you want me, then you can have me
Come on, take me, oh baby grab me

Cause if you want me then you can have me
Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
You're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

Oh now boy what you been and done
You set a course that you couldn't run
Oh now boy what you been and done

I had it all and I risked it
I had it all and I risked it all
And I risked it all
And I risked it all

A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun

A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
I had it all and I risked it all
A ladder to the

Lhuna

( Collaboration with Kylie Minogue )

Kylie:
I'm all by myself
I don't need anybody else
I'm all by myself
No help

I'm all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
I'm all on my own
my own

Chris:
Hello
Won't you let me come in
Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering
Hello
Won't you let me know
'Cause I'm all alone
All alone

Both:
We are dreaming about Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously

Kylie:
I don't know what the time is
I don't know where you've flown
And I don't know why you're so far
From home

The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously
Her and me, effortlessly
Oh her and me effortlessly

Life In Technicolor 2

( Prospekt's March EP )

There's a wild wind blowing
Down the corner of my street
Every night there, the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming
I can hear the silent sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on
Time only can lead you on, still it's
Such a beautiful night

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity, release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground...

Life Is For Living

( Mylo Xyloto Japanese Bonus Track )

Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say

That if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
Don't let it stand in our way

'Cause my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done

But, life is for living
We all know
And I don't wanna live it alone

Lips Like Sugar

( Live Cover / Echo & the Bunnymen )

She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar

Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses

Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
To melt into this lake

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The King of Siam
And my Siamese twin
She knows what I'm thinking
???

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

Lost Highway

( Hank Williams Cover / Live Sydney 2001 )

I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I past by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
On the day we met, oh I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway

Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway

If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If it's gonna rain down, it can rain on me
It can rain on me


Moving To Mars

( Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall EP )

Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown
A government is overthrown
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
And I heard it on the radio
That one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show
That somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart
Maybe moving us to Mars

We won't see the earth again
In these seconds just remain unchanged
Eight to nine, nine to ten
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time
Can't you see
Seven, six, five, four, three
We are meeting for the first time

Singing this space symphony
They'll be tearing us apart
Maybe moving us to Mars
Past the satellites and stars
They're moving us to Mars

Murder

Murder, they're coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And the way we hide

Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And the way we hide

Murder, they're coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And the way we hide

Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said

They're gonna murder me
They're gonna take me down
And even before I sleep
I cry murder

Come and spit at us
Come and throw your weight around
Come and fight with us
Try and knock us to the ground

They're gonna murder me
They're gonna take me down
And even before I sleep
I scream murder
Murder

Oh yeah what can it possibly gain?
Oh what can it possibly gain?
Oh now what can it possibly gain?
Oh yeah what could it possibly gain?

I cry murder
Murder
I cry murder

Murder, all coming to get us
All coming to get us
And the way we hide

Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And the way we hide

Murder, they're coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And the way we hide

Murder, see it all around you
See it all around you
And the way we hide


No More Keeping My Feet On The Ground

( Safety EP )

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me,
But I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
So I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll do, I'll try to stop moving,

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I've got to get going so much that I wanted to do,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

And this could be my last chance,
This may be my only chance,
Yeah this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.

Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
And I move,
And I wake up,
Smiling.

So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll do, well it's time to stop moving.

And this could be my last chance,
This may be my only chance,
Yeah this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.

There's nothing to keep me,
Nothing to keep me.

Ode To Deodorant

( A-side demo / Read more about this song )

Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It keeps me through the day

Another ode, ah to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It's the confidence I need

It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol
It's my thing
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need

It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

It's okay oh, would I ever let you down? No way
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay?
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down...

I'll never let you, I'll never let you, I'll never let you down, no way

Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way

Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground

( Prospekt's March EP )

Let me go boys, let me go
Push my boat from the highest cliff to the sea below
Rocks are waiting boys, rocks await
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like a bird of prey

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Singing, now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my feet won't touch the ground...

One I Love

Could you come back
Come back together
Put yourself on my back
And say its forever
Could you could you come on
Come on forever
Your shouders knees and your back
Are what keep me together

'Cause you're the one I love

Could you could you come in
Come in together
Tie yourself to a mast
It's now or it's never

It's gonna tear us apart
Tell me forever
It's gonna tear us apart love
Or keep us together

'Cause you're the one I love


Only Superstition

( Brothers & Sisters EP )

The copper head I see has found its way to me,
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry.
I sleep but I will not move,
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no.
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day.
But in voices loud and clear you say to me
"it's only superstition.
It's only your imagination,
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things from which you can't escape."
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait and line.
Some numbers are better than others, oh no.
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me "it's only superstition.
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things which you cannot expect."
But it's making me cry, love, and it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away, love, and I'm slipping away
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition.


Pour Me

( Live At The Hollywood Bowl / Fix you EP )

Pour me
I'm floating out to sea
An opportunity that went bad

Pour you
Now what you gonna do
Now what you gonna do
You just cry

Pour me
So blind I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
I don't know why

Pour you
You spit yourself in two
Now what you gonna do
You just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

Pour me
Floating out to sea
An opportunity that went bad

Pour you
Now what you gonna do
Oh what you gonna do
You just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

I don't understand
I don't understand

Oooh
Feel
Ahhh
Aahhh

So now
I'm gonna feel it now
I'm gonna feel it now


Proof

( Speed of sound EP )

So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do
And I'm covered it's true
I'm covered in you

If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light, dark
Bright spark
Light dark
And then
Light

So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say
And all the things in your way
Things happen that way

And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Oh, yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light, dark
Bright spark
Light dark
And then
Light

Light, light, light...

Prospekt's March/Poppyfields

( Prospekt's March EP )

Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet
People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget

Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel
When you've got the gun
Oh and I run
Here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get behind a kind of control
But I wasn't one
Now here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
And here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
I don't wanna die
On my own here tonight
But here I lie
On my own in a separate sky...

Rainy Day

( Prospekt's March EP )

Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and grey
At night it was the bright of the moon with me
Time was just floating
Then there was rain
This town's foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling
And time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to my house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would've broke again
Times were vicious, say
Singing, deeper than the knife goes in before you win
You win but with less than when you begin
Deeper than the knife goes in

Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to my house
I love it when you come over to my house

But I love it when you come over to my house
I love it when you come over to my house
But I love it when you come over to my house
I love it when you come over to my house

Ring Of Fire

( Johnny Cash Cover / live on tour 2005 )

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firey ring
Found my wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went hgher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire was wild

I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire...

See You Soon

( The Blue Room EP )

So you lost your trust,
And you never should have,
And you never should have,
But don't break your back,
If you ever see this,
Don't answer that,

In a bullet-proof vest,
With the windows all closed,
I'll be doing my best,
I'll see you soon,

In a telescope lens,
And when all you want is friends,
I'll see you soon,

So they came for you,
They came snapping at your heels,
They come snapping at your heels,
But don't break your back,
If you ever say this,
But don't answer that,

In a bullet-proof vest,
With the windows all closed,
I'll be doing my best,
I'll see you soon,
In a telescope lens,
And when all you want is friends,
I'll see you soon,
I'll see you soon,

I know, you lost your trust,
I know, you lost your trust,
I know, don't lose your trust.


Sleeping Sun

( Talk EP )

Climb up your mountain
Nineteen and counting
You have got seven
I have got one

Blinded and hurting
This I'm deserving
I've got my secrets
You only got the Sleeping Sun

When you've got a secret
Then you've got to keep it
When you've have a question
Answers will come
Running and hiding
Taking dividing
You've got your secrets
I've only got the Sleeping Sun

The Sleeping Sun

Singing
Oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah

And you as I saw
We're [a] piece in a jigsaw
Run up the divide and
Tip of the tongue
Run round the houses
North and the south is
You've got your answers
We have both got The Sleeping Sun

The Sleeping Sun

Singing
Oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Streets Of Baltimore

( Live / Graham Parsons Cover )

Well I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she used to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Well her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was
Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore
Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore


Such A Rush

( Safety EP )

Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a rush to get nowhere at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush.

And it's just like you said,
It's just like you said.

Such a rush to do nothing at all.
Such a fuss to get nowhere at all.

Such a fuss X2

And it's just like you said.
It's just like you said.

Just slow down please,
Just slow down,
Just slow down please,
Just slow down.

 Such a rush X15

Look at all the people going after money.
Far to many people looking for their money.
Everybody's out there, trying to get money.
Why can't you just tell me,
Try to get money, rush.

Such a rush.
They all rush.
Such a rush X7

Talk (Demo)

Under the great North star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I'll be

In the future, in the past
Going nowhere... much too fast
When I go there, go with me
When I go there, go with me

Cause I don't know where I'm going and I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And I wanna talk
Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show to me
But I don't know what I see

In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

Cause you don't know were you're going and you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
Nothing's really making any sense at all
You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored

Let's talk
Let's talk
Do you wanna talk

I'm up in the part of the throne
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak

I tried but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach
Won't you talk to me

So you don't know were you're going and you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk
Let's talk

The Goldrush

( Live )

I went digging for gold
Down by the river
Over by the mountain
Where the prospektor had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold
I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel and a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine
She said bring me back a diamond/ring 'cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never see the sun

The World Turned Upside Down

( Fix you EP )

X and Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
Three hundred and sixty five degrees
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain
And why am I never gonna sleep again
What is this thing I've never seen before
A little boy lost in a breaking storm

Hide and sob, and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
Three hundred and sixty five degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain
And why am I never gonna sleep again
What is this thing I've never seen before
A little boy lost in a breaking storm

Hide and sob, and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on

Things I Don't Understand

How tides control the sea, and what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change, no two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my wrong from right
Day, all my day for night
Dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life

How infinite is space, and who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat, when truth and fiction meet
Why nothing even turns out how you planned

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my wrong from right
Day, all my day for night
Or dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life


What's Going On

(Chris feat. Bono on All Star Tribute)

Bono :
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying

Chris :
Brother, brother, brother
There's too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay

Bono :
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
And war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate

Chris :
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way

Bono :
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, and you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Together we can be strong

Chris:
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

What The World Needs Now

( Live Sydney 2000 / Burt Bacharach )

What the world needs now
Is love sweet love
No not just for some, but for everyone

Yeah the world needs now
Some love sweet love
That's the only thing that there's just too little of


Where Is My Boy?

( Chris with Fautline )

Where is my boy?
I saw you come out of a scene
Maybe in some kind of dream
Something that never comes.
Time that I take
See over in arms I raise
All racing to find you
All racing to find you.

Time stands
I open your house to my world
I see you come out of it all
Unharmed and unscathed and shouting.

Come over here
And the houses I live in
And changes you're making
To the state of affairs.

Calling where is my boy?
I have seen you so often
I cry where is my boy
Or have you all forgotten?
And in some kind of dream
Have I seen you before?
Have I seen you before?
Where is my boy?

So come all the waves
Changing your number
Changing the house where you live
Change your lines.

Have I seen you before
In some kind of a dream?
In a place you've forgotten
A place I've forgotten.

So where is my boy?
Have I seen you before in some kind of a dream?
Have I seen you before?
Where is my boy?
I say where was my head when I needed it most?
Oh I stayed here before
Yes I'll stay in the place I know.

You Only Live Twice

( Live )

You only live twice or so they say,
One life for yourself, one for the rest.
And you, drift through the years and life seems strange,
Till one dream appears and love is its name.

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.

Oh you, you only live twice or so it seems
One life for yourself, one for your dreams

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.


Your Love Means Everything Part 2

( Chris with Faultline )

I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know.
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw.
It was a strange reaction
for someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide.

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know.
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw.

It was a strange reaction
for someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl.
